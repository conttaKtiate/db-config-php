In this article, we will highlight some of the features and benefits of ETABS 2013 that make it a powerful and versatile tool for structural engineers.
 
## 3D Object Based Modeling and Visualization
 
ETABS 2013 offers a simple and intuitive user interface that allows you to create 3D models of buildings using drawing commands or importing CAD files. You can define different types of structural elements, such as beams, columns, walls, slabs, floors, ramps, stairs, openings, etc., and assign them properties, such as materials, sections, loads, etc. You can also create diaphragms to model floor systems and apply lateral loads to them.
 
ETABS 2013 also provides you with visualization tools that enable you to view your model from different perspectives, render it realistically, display results graphically on the structure, and create animations of dynamic responses. You can also customize the display options to suit your preferences and needs.
 
## Fast Linear and Nonlinear Analytical Power
 
ETABS 2013 uses the state-of-the-art SAPFire 64-bit solver to perform fast and accurate analysis of your model. You can choose from various types of analysis methods, such as linear static, linear dynamic, nonlinear static, nonlinear dynamic, modal, buckling, etc., depending on the complexity and behavior of your structure. You can also perform construction sequencing and time effects analysis to account for creep and shrinkage effects.
 
ETABS 2013 can handle extremely large and complex models with thousands of elements and degrees of freedom. It can also take advantage of multi-core processors and distributed analysis to speed up the solution process.
 
## Sophisticated and Comprehensive Design Capabilities
 
ETABS 2013 can design structures for a wide range of materials, such as steel, concrete, composite, masonry, etc., according to various international codes and standards. You can design steel and concrete frames (with automated optimization), composite beams and columns, steel joists, concrete and masonry shear walls, etc., using built-in design modules or external plugins. You can also check the capacity of steel connections and base plates using integrated tools.
 
ETABS 2013 can perform design checks for strength, stability, serviceability, ductility, etc., and generate detailed design reports that include formulas, references, diagrams, tables, etc. You can also review and modify the design parameters and assumptions as needed.
 
## Insightful Graphic Displays, Reports and Schematic Drawings
 
ETABS 2013 can produce graphic displays of analysis and design results that help you understand and interpret them easily. You can view various types of output data, such as displacements, forces, stresses, strains, moments, reactions, etc., on the structure or on tables and charts. You can also plot response spectra curves, mode shapes, time histories graphs etc., for dynamic analysis.
 
ETABS 2013 can generate comprehensive and customizable reports for all analysis and design output data. You can export the reports to various formats such as PDF , HTML , RTF , etc., or print them directly. You can also create schematic construction drawings of framing plans , schedules , details , cross-sections , etc., for concrete and steel structures using integrated tools or external plugins.
 
## Conclusion
 
ETABS 2013 is a software package that offers unmatched features and benefits for structural analysis and design of buildings. It is a user-friendly , powerful , versatile , fast , accurate , sophisticated , comprehensive , insightful , and integrated software that can handle any type of building project with ease and efficiency.
