# I Doser Premium V5: A Review of the Digital Dosing Software
 
I Doser is a software that claims to simulate various mental states and experiences by using binaural beats. Binaural beats are sound waves that have different frequencies in each ear, creating a perceived third tone that can affect the brainwaves. I Doser offers hundreds of doses, ranging from recreational drugs to meditation, lucid dreaming, and astral projection.

In this article, I will review the I Doser Premium V5 version, which includes all the doses pre-activated and ready to use. I will also compare it to the free version and other alternatives, and share my personal experience with some of the doses.
 
## What is I Doser Premium V5?
 
I Doser Premium V5 is the latest and most advanced version of the I Doser software. It has a sleek and user-friendly interface, with a dose library that can be sorted by category, name, or rating. It also has a dose editor that allows you to create your own custom doses or modify existing ones. You can also export your doses as MP3 files and listen to them on any device.
 
The main advantage of the premium version is that it comes with all the doses pre-activated and ready to use. This means you don't have to buy each dose separately or wait for them to be delivered by email. You can access over 200 doses instantly, including some exclusive ones that are not available in the free version or the online store.
 
The premium version also has some additional features, such as:
 
- A dose adviser that recommends doses based on your mood, goal, or preference.
- A dose tuner that lets you adjust the volume, pitch, and speed of the binaural beats.
- A dose mixer that lets you combine two or more doses for a more intense or varied effect.
- A dose sequencer that lets you create a playlist of doses and set the duration and interval for each one.
- A dose enhancer that uses visual and auditory stimuli to boost the effectiveness of the doses.

## How does I Doser Premium V5 compare to other alternatives?
 
I Doser Premium V5 is not the only software that uses binaural beats to alter your state of mind. There are other alternatives, such as:

- Binaural Beats Meditation: A free app for Android and iOS that offers over 30 binaural beats for relaxation, sleep, focus, creativity, and more.
- Brain.fm: A subscription-based service that provides music with binaural beats for various purposes, such as productivity, meditation, sleep, and relaxation.
- Brainwave: A paid app for iOS that offers over 35 binaural beats for different mental states and activities, such as learning, memory, mood, energy, and more.

These alternatives have some advantages over I Doser Premium V5, such as:

- They are cheaper or free.
- They are more accessible and convenient.
- They have more variety and customization options.
- They have more scientific evidence and positive reviews.

However, I Doser Premium V5 also has some advantages over these alternatives, such as:

- It has some unique and exclusive doses that are not available elsewhere.
- It has a loyal and active community of users who share their experiences and feedback.
- It has a more realistic and immersive simulation of different substances and sensations.

## What are some of the most popular doses in I Doser Premium V5?
