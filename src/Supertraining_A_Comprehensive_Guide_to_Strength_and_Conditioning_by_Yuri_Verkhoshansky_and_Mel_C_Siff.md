# Supertraining: A Comprehensive Guide to Strength and Conditioning by Yuri Verkhoshansky and Mel C. Siff
 
Supertraining is a book that covers all aspects of strength and conditioning, from the biomechanics and physiology of muscle action to the principles and methods of special strength training. It is written by two renowned experts in the field: Yuri Verkhoshansky, a former Soviet sports scientist and coach who pioneered the concept of shock training and plyometrics, and Mel C. Siff, a former professor of biomechanics and exercise science who authored many books and articles on sports performance.

The book is divided into six parts, each containing several chapters that explore different topics related to strength and conditioning. The first part introduces the concept of strength and the muscular system, explaining the origins of strength training science, the fundamental principle of strength training, the neural changes with training, the factors limiting strength production, the biomechanics of strength, the specificity and fitness of strength, the nature and classification of strength, the muscle complex and its structure and function, the types of muscle action and fibre, the mechanism of muscle growth, the neurophysiological and bioenergetic aspects of exercise, and the adaptation and training effect.
 
The second part focuses on sport specific strength training, discussing the concept of special strength training, the Russian system of classifying athletes, the early stages of strength training, the schemes for perfecting movements, the functional topography of the muscular system, the motor specialization in developing sports mastery, and the heterochronicity specialization processes.
 
The third part deals with explosive strength development, describing the concept of explosive strength, the factors influencing explosive strength production, the methods of developing explosive strength (such as shock method or depth jumps), the means of developing explosive strength (such as weightlifting exercises or medicine ball throws), the programming of explosive strength training (such as intensity zones or loading patterns), and the testing and evaluation of explosive strength.
 
The fourth part examines speed-strength development, defining the concept of speed-strength, the factors influencing speed-strength production, the methods of developing speed-strength (such as dynamic effort method or ballistic method), the means of developing speed-strength (such as plyometric exercises or elastic resistance), the programming of speed-strength training (such as contrast loading or complex training), and the testing and evaluation of speed-strength.
 
The fifth part explores special strength development, outlining the concept of special strength, the problem of methods, the general principles of special strength training, the development of maximum strength (such as repetitive effort method or brief maximal tension method), the development of speed-strength endurance (such as interval method or circuit method), and the development of reactive ability (such as rebound method or drop jump method).
 
The sixth part reviews supplementary information on strength training, providing additional insights on topics such as flexibility training (such as static stretching or dynamic stretching), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques (such as contract-relax or hold-relax), vibration training (such as whole-body vibration or local vibration), electrical stimulation (such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or neuromuscular electrical stimulation), hypoxic training (such as altitude training or intermittent hypoxic exposure), blood flow restriction training (such as occlusion training or ischemic preconditioning), nutritional supplements (such as creatine or caffeine), recovery methods (such as massage or cryotherapy), injury prevention and rehabilitation (such as warm-up or eccentric exercise), psychological factors (such as motivation or arousal), pedagogical factors (such as feedback or learning styles), and research methods (such as experimental design or statistical analysis).
 
Supertraining is a comprehensive guide to strength and conditioning that offers both theoretical knowledge and practical applications for athletes and coaches. It is based on scientific evidence and empirical experience from two leading authorities in the field. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in improving their performance in any sport or physical activity.
